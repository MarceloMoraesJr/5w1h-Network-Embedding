That complex and compelling opera was finally given its premiere in Santa Fe in 2010. This recording offers his 2012 vespers cantata, “Hesperus Is Phosphorus,” performed by the Philadelphia forces that commissioned it: the Crossing, the superb contemporary-music vocal ensemble, and Network for New Music. The title plays on the belief of the early Greeks that Phosphorus was the morning star, and Hesperus the evening one, before they realized that the two were one celestial body, Venus. The inventive text draws together writings by David Eagleman, Wallace Stevens, Richard Feynman, Wallace Shawn and others. Mr. Spratlan’s pungently modern language comes through continually in this intricate 65-minute score. Still, he sets words for clarity, often in long stretches of spiky block chords. A beautiful recording of a sensual and mysterious work. (ANTHONY TOMMASINI)',\n",
